# Seattle Airbnb Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict Airbnb listing prices in Seattle using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features such as location, number of rooms, amenities, and reviews, we seek to understand the key factors influencing pricing decisions. The goal is to provide insights that can help Airbnb hosts optimize their pricing strategies.

## Business Problem
Airbnb property owners often struggle to set the right price for their listings, especially in competitive markets like Seattle. This project attempts to answer key questions like:
- What factors influence the price of Airbnb listings?
- How can we predict the price of an Airbnb listing based on features like location, amenities, and reviews?
- Which features have the greatest impact on pricing decisions for Airbnb hosts?

## Modeling Approach
We used machine learning techniques to develop a model that predicts Airbnb listing prices. The following steps were followed:
1. **Data Collection**: We used the Seattle Airbnb dataset containing over 10,000 listings with details on price, location, amenities, and reviews.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Missing values and categorical variables were handled appropriately to prepare the data for modeling.
3. **Feature Engineering**: We identified key features such as location, number of rooms, and guest reviews that impact pricing.
4. **Modeling**: Linear regression was used to predict the price of Airbnb listings based on various features.
5. **Evaluation**: We evaluated the model's performance using prediction accuracy and compared the predicted values to the actual prices.

## Results
The analysis revealed several key insights:
1. **Location** is the most significant factor affecting the price of Airbnb listings.
2. **Size of the property** (number of rooms and beds) plays a major role in determining pricing.
3. Listings with **higher guest ratings and reviews** tend to have higher prices.

The predictive model showed a reasonable degree of accuracy in forecasting prices based on the available features.
